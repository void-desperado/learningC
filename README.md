# learningC

A versioned record of my C programming journey

This repository serves as a professional log of all the C programs I develop as I progress from foundational concepts to more advanced topics. Each directory corresponds to a specific lesson or concept with source code acting as an organized view of my growth as a C programmer.

2) Study Plan
   
    I follow a disciplined, chapter-wise approach combining two classic texts:
    
    - Primary Text:  
      "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie  
    - Reference:  
      "Let Us C" by Yashavant Kanetkar
    
    For each chapter (e.g. Chapter 1):  
    1. Read the chapter in K&R.  
    2. Reproduce all code examples in `01_chapter-1/examples/`.  
    3. Solve relevant practice questions from Let Us C and write codes for practice exercises of K&R in `01_chapter-1/exercises/`.
  
    I will also be practicing problems from leetcode and other such sites with an aim of one problem per day.

3) Chapterwise source codes
   
    Chapter 1: Introduction & Basics
    Chapter 2: Variables & Operators
    Chapter 3: Control Flow
    Chapter 4: Functions & Program Structure
    Chapter 5: Pointers & Arrays
    Chapter 6: Structures & Unions
    Chapter 7: Input & Output
    Chapter 8: The UNIX System Interface

4) Projects

    Future Projects  
        Once I’ve worked through all chapters, I’ll pick one or more of these to build as capstones:
    
    - CLI Utilities  
      - A simple file-management tool (e.g. `myls`, `mycp`)  
      - A to-do list manager that reads/writes a text file  
    - Data Structures Library  
      - Implement linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables in pure C  
    - Mini Shell
      - Parse and execute basic shell commands, handle pipes and redirection  
    - Text Editor  
      - A terminal-based editor with basic navigation and search  
    - Networked Chat Server  
      - A simple TCP-based chat app (client + server)  
    - File Compression Tool  
      - Implement a basic run-length or Huffman coding compressor
